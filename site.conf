        # When a user clicks on an external link on the NERDD website, the Referrer-Policy header 
        # determines which information is sent to the external website. This way the destination 
        # website can learn about the incoming traffic source. We use the value
        # "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" that does the following:
        # * If destination is on same origin, allows the full url (nerdd.univie.ac.at/page) to be 
        #   sent.
        # * If destination is on a different origin, only the domain (nerdd.univie.ac.at) is sent.
        # * Does not allow any information to be sent when a scheme downgrade (https -> http) 
        #   happens (prevents an attacker to read the referrer field in the insecure http request).
        # 
        # Examples:
        # | Origin                               | Destination                           | Referrer field
